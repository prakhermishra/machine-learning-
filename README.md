# MACHINE-LEARNING-

The objective here is to give you a wholistic understanding of machine learning, covering theory, application,
and inner workings of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms.

Algorithms such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, 
and neural networks.
